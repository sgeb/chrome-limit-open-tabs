# chrome-limit-open-tabs: a Chrome extension helping compulsive tab openers by limiting the number of tabs chrome will open.

## Feature backlog / TODO
- actually disallow Chrome from opening tabs when limit reached
- options screen to customize the limit of open tabs
- option to count pinned tabs, default is to ignore them
- option to count per window or across browser session
- soft limit: don't strictly disallow tab opening, support for tab bursts but warn/alert after a given time (e.g. 5 mins)
- change icon color depending on number of open tabs (closer to limit => red)
